# Final Project Part I: The Dramatic Rise of Computer Science vs. Slower Progress in Other Fields

## Introduction

In the past few decades, **Computer Science (CS)** has grown at an unprecedented rate, from the early days of room-sized computers to modern-day AI, smartphones, and internet products. This project aims to showcase the **dramatic advancements in CS** and related technologies compared to the slower progress in other fields, such as **rocketry, biology, physics**, and **mathematics**.

The story will compare the **exponential growth of CS**—from **Moore’s Law** to the rise of AI, the internet, and smartphones—against the relatively stagnant development in other fields like rocketry, which, despite advances such as SpaceX, has not seen groundbreaking changes since the Apollo missions. Similarly, other sciences, such as biology and physics, while important, have not experienced the rapid shifts in technological innovation seen in CS.

Through this project, I will use data to highlight:
1. The **rapid growth and transformation of CS and internet products** over the past decades.
2. The **slow, incremental development** in other fields, including rocketry, biology, and mathematics.
3. The current state of innovation in CS, where we may have reached a plateau with only incremental updates each year (e.g., smartphone models).

## Project Structure

### Story Arc
The project will follow a story arc that highlights:
1. **Introduction**: Provide context about the fast-paced advancements in CS, contrasting with other fields.
2. **Rising Action**: Present data on milestones in CS and related technologies—computer evolution, AI advancements, the internet, and smartphones.
3. **Climax**: Compare the growth of CS with the slow development in other fields (e.g., biology, rocketry, and physics).
4. **Falling Action**: Explore the current plateau in CS, where innovation is incremental (e.g., small updates in iPhones and other products).
5. **Conclusion**: Speculate on the future of innovation in CS and the potential for breakthroughs in other fields.

### One-Sentence Summary
"This project visualizes the rapid advancements in Computer Science and internet products over the past few decades, in contrast to the slower development seen in other fields such as rocketry, biology, and physics."
