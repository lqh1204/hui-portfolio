# Part III: Final Deliverable and Presentation

## 1. Final Writeup

### Project Overview

In this project, I explored the trajectory of tech layoffs and the shifting landscape for tech professionals, with a focus on where displaced employees are finding new opportunities. This narrative addresses how recent graduates, current tech employees, and aspiring tech professionals can adapt to the changing industry landscape. The story examines the key factors behind layoffs, the migration of tech talent, and the potential of AI in shaping the future job market.

### Changes Made Since Part II

After receiving feedback from Part II, I made several key adjustments to enhance the clarity and focus of my final narrative:
- **Refined Narrative Structure:** Emphasizing the journey tech professionals take post-layoff, I focused on the topic "Where Are Laid-Off Tech Employees Going?" This refined approach sets up a natural progression from the causes of layoffs to career adaptations and relocation trends, particularly highlighting Canada.
- **Target Audience Focus:** The target audience was expanded to include recent graduates, students, and current employees. Based on feedback, the Call-to-Action was revised to offer practical advice tailored to individuals at different stages in their tech careers.
- **Data Visualization Enhancements:** Visualizations were updated based on insights from the interviews, providing a clearer picture of migration patterns, career transitions, and the role of AI in tech layoffs.
- **User Research Implementation:** Based on the feedback from interviews, the story includes tailored advice for students, recent graduates, and tech professionals. I incorporated additional visuals and graphs that relate directly to the interests and concerns of this audience.

### Audience and Design Considerations

#### Audience
- **Primary Audience:** Recent graduates, current students, and tech professionals interested in understanding and preparing for the shifting tech job market.
- **Secondary Audience:** Recruiters, policy makers, and companies seeking to retain and attract talent in a changing landscape.

#### Design Decisions
- **Visual Aesthetics:** I chose a clean, modern aesthetic, drawing on inspiration from tech-focused publications and online platforms. A consistent color palette was used for readability, with blues and greys for a professional look, accented with orange to highlight important sections.
- **Layout and User Flow:** I structured the story to be engaging and easy to follow, moving from cause (layoffs) to effect (career changes and relocation). Wireframes from Part II were converted into final visualizations, each aligned with the narrative to lead the reader seamlessly through the storyline.
- **Interactivity and Accessibility:** The Shorthand platform was chosen for its interactivity and responsiveness, ensuring accessibility across different devices. Key takeaways and action points are highlighted at the end of each section to reinforce learning and engagement.

### Key Insights from the Process

Throughout the development of this project, I learned about the value of connecting data visualization with storytelling. It was essential to maintain a balance between presenting data and conveying a narrative that resonates with the audience. The feedback process highlighted the importance of user-centered design and the value of adjusting content based on the target audience's needs and preferences.

## 3. Final Report Text for TurnItIn

In addition to the online story, a Word document containing the text from the Shorthand story is prepared for submission on TurnItIn. This document ensures compliance with academic integrity standards, with all necessary citations and references included. Images and data used in the report were reviewed to avoid copyright issues and ensure proper citation.

## 4. Final Presentation

The final presentation will cover the project’s narrative structure, visualizations, and key findings, with a focus on the implications for current and aspiring tech professionals. The presentation will be delivered in person, as scheduled. Key sections will be accompanied by visual aids that summarize the main points and support audience engagement.

### Reflection on Learning

Creating this project highlighted the importance of data storytelling as a tool to simplify complex narratives. Through the process, I gained a deeper understanding of the tech industry’s evolving challenges and how it affects professionals at all levels. This project emphasized the power of well-crafted visualizations and user feedback in making data-driven stories accessible and impactful. I look forward to sharing these insights during the final presentation.

## 5. GitHub Repository
