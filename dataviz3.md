# Debt-to-GDP Trends for G7 Countries (2000–2022)

This line chart shows the debt-to-GDP ratios for G7 countries from 2000 to 2022. The visualization tracks changes in government debt over time for each country, allowing a comparison of debt trends among major economies.

## Comparison of Visualizations:

The line chart for G7 countries provides a clear view of how government debt-to-GDP ratios have evolved over time. Each line represents a G7 country, and the continuous nature of the chart allows us to easily identify trends, peaks, and declines from 2000 to 2022.

### How It Compares:
- **Bar Chart**: The bar chart (Part 1) provided a good overview of government debt for a single year, but it lacked the ability to show changes over time.
- **Heat Map**: The heat map (Part 2) allowed us to compare multiple countries and years, with color coding providing a quick sense of debt levels. However, it didn’t show trends as smoothly as the line chart.
- **Line Chart (Part 3)**: The line chart offers a more intuitive way to visualize changes over time and compare trends across countries. This makes it easier to spot long-term debt patterns for each country in the G7. For example, Japan’s persistently high debt levels are clearly visible, while Germany shows more stability.

The decision to use a line chart for this subset of data was based on the need to emphasize trends over time, which are not as easily conveyed by static bar charts or heat maps.
