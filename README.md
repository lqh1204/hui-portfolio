# About Me
Hi, my name is Hugo Hui, and I'm currently enrolled in the Telling Stories with Data course. I'm passionate about using data to create compelling narratives that drive decisions. I'm pursuing a MISM program at CMU and have an interest in data visualization and storytelling. Outside of academics, I enjoy readings, which also inspire my work in data analytics. I'm excited to connect with others in this course and beyond.

# What I Hope to Learn
In this course, I hope to enhance my skills in data visualization and storytelling. I want to learn how to transform complex data sets into clear, compelling stories that can influence and inform decision-making. After graduating, I plan to work in tech industries, where I can apply these skills to real-world problems.
